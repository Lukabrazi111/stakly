# Stakly Milestones

Frontend-first build. UI against real DB infrastructure + seeded fake data; backend logic (escrow, payouts, on-chain integration) lands per page once the UI is validated. Milestones are work-chunk labels, not version commitments — decisions inside any of them are revisitable.

> **Shipped milestones live in `milestones_archived.md`** (M1, M2, M2.5, M3, M3.5, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8 all phases, M10, M11, M12 all phases, M14 all phases, M16 all phases, M17, M18, M19, M22, M23, M24, M25, M26 all phases, M27 all phases, M29 all phases, M30 all phases, M31 all phases, M32 all phases). **Parked milestones** (work that isn't being picked up right now) also live in the archive — currently M13. This file is for active + upcoming work + the cross-cutting architectural decisions that earlier milestones established.

## Phases (map)

**Recently shipped** (this week):

- **M14** — Outcome pipeline hardening (all phases shipped 2026-05-22 → 2026-06-06). Slice A (chess card arbitration), Phase 1 (per-match audit trail + `PipelineHealth` widget), Phase 2 (reliability — `ProviderError` hierarchy, classified job retry policy, `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-Reset` parsing, per-provider circuit breaker + dashboard banner), Phase 3 (coverage — aborted-as-draw refund, multi-candidate picker, single-candidate time-control enforcement), Phase 4 Slice 4a (flag-gated `OpenDisputeAction` → `ResolveDisputeAction` fast-path). Slice 4b is a calendar checkpoint — flip the flag after ~2 weeks of stable Phase 1 telemetry.
- **M30** — Admin user management (all 6 phases, 2026-06-03 → 2026-06-04). UserResource, ban toggle + four enforcement guards, mandatory 2FA on admin role, on-every-login 2FA challenge via Fortify bridge, user-facing ban feedback (banner + bell + email), impersonation via `stechstudio/filament-impersonate` + Stakly audit/reason/expiry layer.
- **M31** — Admin wallet ledger (both phases, 2026-06-04). Read-only `WalletTransactionResource` with filters + sum summarizer, ViewWalletTransaction with infolist + reference-ID parser + sibling-entity lookup.
- **M32** — Admin listing management (both phases, 2026-06-04). Read-only `ListingResource` with status/platform/creator/stake/region/language filters, ViewListing with infolist (details + related match if Taken + wallet transactions via M31 parser) + force-cancel action routed through `CancelListingAction`. **Admin trio now complete — every state on the platform is investigable + actionable from `/admin` without Tinker.**
- **M26** — Filament-managed CMS pages + global SSR + full-site i18n (all 4 phases, 2026-05-29 → 2026-06-05). Admin-editable About / Privacy / Terms / Support, global Inertia SSR (homepage / listings / profiles / CMS first-byte HTML), full i18n framework (locale-prefix routing, `useT()` / `__()` bridge, `LocaleSwitcher`, Inertia-rendered 403/404/500/503 pages). `lang/en.json` at ~790 keys; `ka.json` / `ru.json` content backlog.

**In-flight:**

_None — pick the next milestone from "Active / upcoming" below._

**Active / upcoming:**

- **M15** — Multi-game expansion (FACEIT, OpenDota, Riot adapters). Promoted next-up post-M14 — phases will expand alongside an API-research pass (Lichess / chess.com depth read first, then FACEIT / OpenDota / Riot) before any code lands. Per-game catalog + provider table already laid out below.
- **M28** — Designed Fees page. Hand-coded marketing surface — transparent 5–10% commission disclosure, interactive calculator, replaces footer Support link in header nav. Pre-launch trust signal; design-driven (`ui-ux-pro-max` skill).
- **M20** — Email notifications. **Spec materially shrunk**: M27 P5 already shipped the in-app preferences UI + `notification_preferences` table + 9 `PlayerNotification` classes; M30 P4 wired the `mail` channel for ban notifications. What's left = branded HTML email templates, flip `'mail'` into `via()` on the remaining PlayerNotification subclasses, production SMTP config. Realistically 2–3 days.
- **M21** — Blacklist + safety. Block users from listings + chat, with anti-evasion considerations. Has open design questions (block semantics + multi-account evasion) — needs alignment before coding.

> Active milestone keeps a detailed task list. Future milestones expand when started. Any of this can shift — flag the change, update the doc.

## Architectural decisions

Decisions made earlier that have shaped a lot of code downstream. Not locked — revisit if the situation changes, just expect a ripple of refactor when you do.

- **Money writes only through `App\Services\Wallet`** (M3.5). `users.usdt_balance` and `wallet_transactions` are written ONLY by Wallet service methods. The invariant `users.usdt_balance == SUM(wallet_transactions.amount)` is asserted in `WalletTest.php`. Direct writes from controllers / seeders / migrations / factories / tinker break this.
- **Money math is BCMath strings, never floats** (M3.5). Internal arithmetic at scale 6 via `bcadd` / `bcsub` / `bccomp`. Floats only appear at the API resource boundary.
- **Append-only ledger** (M3.5). No `updated_at` on `wallet_transactions`. Idempotency via optional `reference_id` — repeat calls return the existing row silently.
- **Actions pattern** (M11). Business logic lives in `app/Actions/<Domain>/<Verb><Noun>Action.php` with a `handle()` method, container-injected. Controllers and commands are thin adapters. `App\Services\Wallet` and `App\Services\GameApi\*` stay as primitives, not Actions. Decompose long `handle()` bodies into private helpers so `handle()` reads like a recipe of high-level steps.
- **`MatchStatus` state machine guard** (M6 Phase 7). `SettleMatchAction` / `SettleDrawMatchAction` no-op on `Settled` (idempotency), proceed on `Pending` / `Disputed`, throw on `ManualReview` or unknown. Future admin tools resolving `ManualReview` must use a different path.
- **`ManualReview` is admin-resolved out-of-band**, not in player chat (M6 Phase 7). Admin reads via Filament dashboard (M12); no admin-in-chat.
- **Snapshot, don't link** when a relationship needs to survive identity changes (M8 Phase 4). Linked-account usernames are denormalized onto the sibling `match_provider_snapshots` table at match creation so a mid-match unlink doesn't break dispute resolution. Sibling table (not flat columns on `game_matches`) so per-provider identifier shape can grow with multi-identifier games (M15) without re-migrating the wide table.
- **One arbitration driver per game family** (M14 Slice A). `ChessGameApi` handles both Lichess and chess.com cards via the card's `provider` discriminator. M15 game adapters (FACEIT, Riot, etc.) each get their own sibling driver. No multi-provider chain wrappers — the card carries its own provider field.
- **`is_platform = true` users are never user-facing** (M3.5 + M5). Filtered from profile show, wallet UI, listing pages.
- **No chain code or smart contracts right now** (project-wide). Custodial via internal Postgres ledger; chain integration is M9, paused for a specialist.
- **Strongest anti-cheat per game** (M8 + M15). Stakly only takes stakes on matches played on the strongest available anti-cheat platform for the relevant game. The verification provider (who tells us the result) and the anti-cheat platform (where the match must be played) are conceptually separate — sometimes the same vendor (FACEIT for CS2, Riot for Valorant), sometimes different (Steam-ranked Dota 2 verified via OpenDota). Per-game adapter pattern via `LinkedAccountProvider` enum + `ProfileClient` interface + `listings.platform` column.
- **User-supplied free-text never lands in system messages** (M10 Phase 3). System messages bypass the M13 chat anti-abuse layer by construction. Any user-supplied text (cancellation reasons, future dispute notes, etc.) surfaces in structured banner UI we control — never spliced into chat lifecycle narration. The banner is the sanitization surface; chat stays for player-to-player communication that DOES go through M13 filters.
- **Outcome is API-truth, not player self-report** (M16). Match results come from the game API (Lichess stream, chess.com archive polling) — not from "I won / lost / drawn" player buttons. Player self-reports were always non-binding (the API was the tiebreaker on disagreement); M16 removes the redundant confirm layer entirely. The dispute surface (`Report a problem`) survives as the manual escalation path for unresolvable cases. "Mutual cancellation" (M10) remains the cooperative early-exit when no game gets played.
- **Trust signal = single composite "completion rate", not per-failure-mode rates** (M18 Phase 3 Slice B). One metric — "of your engaged matches, how many reached Settled?" — replaces separate dispute + cancellation rate badges. Positive framing (higher = better), forgiveness buffer for cooperative cancellation (3 free per rolling 30 days), no arbitrary threshold colors, no initiator-vs-defender ambiguity (a match that's disputed-then-settled is still a completion for both parties). Rolling 30-day headline + lifetime breakdown in the "more info" modal. Shown on both profile pages and listing rows so the signal travels with the user wherever their reputation might matter.

## M20 — Notifications (email + preferences)

Stakly currently sends almost no user-facing notifications (Fortify email-verification + password-reset only). M20 adds match-event emails + a per-user preferences surface — M20 owns the UI surface end-to-end (M19 dropped its placeholder tab on 2026-05-27).

### Phases

**Phase 1 — Notification infrastructure**

- [ ] Queue + driver setup (Postgres queue already exists via Sail; mail via Mailpit in dev, real SMTP later).
- [ ] Base `Mail` classes with Stakly branding (logo, dark-mode-friendly template, footer with unsubscribe / preferences link).
- [ ] Test infrastructure for email assertions (`Mail::fake()` patterns).

**Phase 2 — Triggers**

- [ ] Match taken (creator notified when someone takes their listing).
- [ ] Match settled (both players notified, with payout / loss outcome).
- [ ] Dispute opened (other player notified).
- [ ] Cancellation requested (other player notified).
- [ ] Cancellation accepted / rejected (requester notified).
- [ ] ManualReview flagged (both players notified — match is in admin queue).
- [ ] Deposit confirmed (when M9 lands — chain integration writes a real ledger entry).

**Phase 3 — Preferences UI**

- [ ] `notification_preferences` table (or JSON column on users) — per-event opt-in/out.
- [ ] Default: all event types ON.
- [ ] UI lives on a new `/settings/notifications` page (M19 dropped the placeholder tab on 2026-05-27; M20 owns the surface end-to-end). Toggle per event with sensible groupings.
- [ ] Always-on events: account-security (verification, password reset, login from new device). User cannot turn these off.

### Not in M20

- Push / SMS / in-app notifications — email is the v1 channel. Other channels can land as separate slices when scale demands.
- Per-user delivery cadence (daily digest, etc.) — start with per-event real-time; revisit if users push for digest mode.

---

## M21 — Blacklist + safety

Block specific users from interacting with you. Real safety feature with abuse-vector considerations.

### Design questions to resolve before building

1. **What does blocking actually do?** Lean: **all of the following** — a blocked user is fully invisible to you in both directions.
   - Block from taking your listings (they can't take + your listings hide from their marketplace view).
   - Block from sending you chat messages on matches you're already in.
   - Hide blocked users' listings from your marketplace view.
2. **Abuse vector — multi-account evasion.** A blocked user creates a new account, links the same chess.com handle, takes your listing anyway. Mitigations:
   - `linked_accounts` already enforces UNIQUE(provider, username) — same handle can't be re-linked elsewhere.
   - Block by `user_id` AND by snapshot of `linked_accounts.username` so blocking follows verified identity, not just the row.
   - Trade-off: if a player legitimately unlinks and someone else later claims the old handle, the new player inherits the blacklist. Edge case worth flagging in the block-flow UX.
3. **Abuse vector — vindictive block.** Bob loses to Alice, blocks Alice to dodge future matches. Hurts Bob (smaller opponent pool) more than Alice. Self-correcting; not really an abuse to mitigate.

### Phases

**Phase 1 — Schema + block list model**

- [ ] `blocks` table: `id`, `blocker_user_id` (restrict-delete), `blocked_user_id` (set-null), `blocked_provider` + `blocked_username` (identity snapshot for unlink-survival), `reason` nullable, `created_at`. UNIQUE(blocker, blocked).
- [ ] `Block` model with relations + a `blocksUserOrIdentity()` query helper.

**Phase 2 — Take-listing + chat-send guards**

- [ ] `TakeListingAction` checks: does the listing creator block this taker (by user_id OR by current linked-account username)? Abort with a 403 + neutral message ("This listing is no longer available") — don't leak the block.
- [ ] `SendMessageAction` checks: is the recipient blocking this sender? Soft error.
- [ ] Tests for both guards (block-by-id and block-by-username paths).

**Phase 3 — Marketplace + profile visibility**

- [ ] Marketplace index hides listings whose creator is on the viewer's blocklist (filtered out of the query).
- [ ] Blocked user's profile renders an explicit "You've blocked this user" banner instead of their content (with an unblock button).
- [ ] Blocker's profile renders normally to the blocked user (no visibility leak about being blocked — they just can't take listings / send messages).

**Phase 4 — Blacklist UI**

- [ ] List of blocked users lives on a new `/settings/blacklist` page (M19 dropped the placeholder tab on 2026-05-27; M21 owns the surface end-to-end).
- [ ] Block-action UI on the OTHER user's public profile (small menu when viewing as visitor): "Block this user". Optional reason field.
- [ ] Unblock from the list.
- [ ] Tests: block flow, unblock flow, marketplace filtering.

### Not in M21

- Reporting / admin escalation from blocks — abuse reporting lives with M13 (chat anti-abuse, parked).
- IP-based blocking — easy to evade, low value. User-identity blocking is sufficient.
- "Stakly Trust Score" / reputation tracking based on block counts — feels gameable; defer.

## M15 — Multi-game expansion

The multi-game realization of M8's per-provider adapter pattern. Where M8 builds chess (chess.com + Lichess), M15 brings every other game Stakly eventually supports — each game arriving as its own adapter following the same shape. Phases intentionally left open; scope and ordering to be decided with the lead dev before any work starts.

The trust pitch this milestone earns: **Stakly only takes stakes on matches played on the strongest available anti-cheat platform for that game.** Per-game catalog:

| Game     | Played on (anti-cheat)                            | Verification API                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Chess    | chess.com or Lichess (native fair-play detection) | chess.com / Lichess (shipped in M8)                   |
| CS2      | FACEIT (FACEIT AC required)                       | FACEIT Data API                                       |
| Dota 2   | FACEIT Hub or Steam ranked                        | FACEIT (if played there) or OpenDota (Steam matches)  |
| Valorant | Ranked Valorant (Vanguard required)               | Riot Games API                                        |
| LoL      | Ranked LoL (Vanguard rolling out)                 | Riot Games API                                        |

Games without a usable anti-cheat platform AND a verification API (Fortnite, Apex, COD, FIFA, fighting games, mobile games) are out of scope until either changes — not because they're impossible, but because the trust pitch doesn't hold for them.

**Architectural composition** — mostly the existing shapes, with one extension called out below:

- `LinkedAccountProvider` enum gains `Faceit`, `Riot`, possibly `Steam` (for the OpenDota / Steam-ranked Dota 2 path).
- New `ProfileClient` implementations: `FaceitProfileClient`, `RiotProfileClient` (likely split per region), `SteamProfileClient`. Bio-code paste flow per provider where the platform exposes an editable profile field; OAuth where available (FACEIT and Riot both expose it — cleaner UX, requires app approval).
- `Game` enum gains `Cs2`, `Dota2`, `Valorant`, `Lol`.
- `listings.platform` (M8 Phase 5) expands its allowed values to include the new platforms.
- New game-result clients (`FaceitGameClient`, `OpenDotaGameClient`, `RiotGameClient`) mirror M8's `LichessGameClient` / `ChessComGameClient` — first wired into chat link-card enrichment, later into the auto-resolver via M14.
- New arbitration drivers per game family (sibling to `ChessGameApi`): `FaceitGameApi`, `RiotGameApi`, etc. Each reads its own provider's cards from chat.
- Webhooks where the provider supports them (FACEIT match-completed, Riot match-end) reduce polling cost when M14 lands.

**`match_provider_snapshots` table — extending to non-chess identifiers**:

The sibling snapshot table that landed in M8 Phase 4 is already in place. Today each row is `(match_id, side, provider, username)` — sufficient for chess.com + Lichess. When CS2 / Dota 2 / Valorant land, each will need additional identifier columns: Steam ID (uint64 — likely `string(20)`), Faceit player ID (uuid), Riot ID region (varchar 4), maybe MMR at snapshot for sandbag-detection surfaces.

Two ways to extend:

1. **Add nullable columns per identifier** as each game adapter ships (`steam_id`, `faceit_id`, `riot_region`, `mmr_at_snapshot`, etc.). Type-safe, query-friendly, but the table accumulates per-game-specific columns. Probably fine — Stakly's planned game catalog tops out at ~6-7 providers, so the column count stays manageable.
2. **Add a `provider_data` JSONB column** alongside `username` to carry the variable-shape per-provider extras. Schema stays narrow; per-provider parsing happens in the adapter. Cost is no DB-level uniqueness on those extras.

Decide per-adapter when the first non-chess one ships. The current `username` column is sized 64 to cover Riot IDs (`name#tag`, 16+5 chars) and Steam vanity URLs (up to 32) without a length migration.

**Cross-cutting smurf / sandbag defense** — FACEIT-class anti-cheat solves "no aimbots in CS2" but does not solve "experienced player hides behind a fresh account." That second threat is mitigated by Stakly's verified-rating system: bio-code linked accounts carry rating history; listings can require a minimum rating (`listings.skill_min`, already in the schema). Both layers need to be in place for the trust pitch to actually hold.

**Per-game listings filter UI** — `/listings` has a per-game tab strip (`ListingsGameTabs`) above the filter bar. **CS2 + Dota 2 ship as M15 placeholders** (`App\Enums\Game::Cs2`, `Game::Dota2`; `LinkedAccountProvider::Faceit`, `Steam` with stub `displayName()` + `usernamePattern()`; catalog status flipped to Active; `ListingFactory::forGame()` + `ListingSeeder` distribute dev-seed listings across all 3 Active games). Browse + per-game filter UX is testable end-to-end today; **Create flow is still chess-only** — no FACEIT/Steam ProfileClient or bio-code verification yet. Chess-specific filter widgets (the `Blitz / Rapid / Classical` time-control toggle group) are gated by `gameSupports(filters.game, 'time_control')` and live inline in `listing-filters-bar.tsx` / `listing-filters.tsx`. **When the real adapters land, extract chess-specific filter UI into a sibling component (`ChessFormatFilter`, `ChessSkillRangeFilter`) and create matching per-game siblings (`Cs2FormatFilter`, `DotaSkillRangeFilter`, etc.).** The form just branches: `{filters.game === 'chess' && <ChessFormatFilter />}{filters.game === 'cs2' && <Cs2FormatFilter />}`. No premature generic-filter-interface abstraction — the shape of "what's variable between games" emerges from the second game, not the first. The `time_control` URL filter resets on game-switch (`switchGame()` in `pages/listings/index.tsx`); when the second adapter lands, expand the reset set to drop all game-specific filters during the switch. Skill range is held over because cross-game skill-metric semantics (Elo vs MMR vs Faceit ELO) are theoretical until real M15 wiring — design that filter UX alongside the actual game. Frontend type discipline already in place: `ChessProvider` (narrow, `chess_com | lichess`) for verified linked-account contexts vs `ListingPlatform` (wide, `ChessProvider | faceit | steam`) for the listing's actual platform field — when M15 wires real FACEIT/Steam linking, the narrow contexts widen too.

### Not in M15

- Auto-resolution from those adapters — that's M14, gated on volume.
- Filament admin moderation surfaces for the new game types — covered by M12 (shipped). New game types automatically appear in the existing `GameMatchResource` queue.
- Marketing / homepage copy for the anti-cheat trust pitch — separate from engineering scope; revisit alongside the existing marquee-copy cleanup.
- Aggregator-as-a-service (PandaScore / Bayes / Abios) — considered and parked. Reconsider only if the per-game maintenance burden gets painful and revenue can absorb the monthly cost.

## M28 — Designed Fees page

A standalone, hand-coded React page at `/fees` that explains Stakly's 5–10% commission visually and transparently, with an interactive calculator and brand-grade design. This is the **highest-leverage marketing surface** on the site — money platforms must answer "what's your cut?" before users will sign up, and a designed page (vs a CMS prose page) lets us turn that disclosure into a trust signal instead of a wall of legal text.

Not CMS-managed on purpose. The Filament CMS template (`cms/page.tsx`) is intentionally simple — correct for About / Privacy / Terms, wrong for a marketing landing that wants animation, an interactive calculator, scroll-triggered reveals, and a comparison block. Editing copy on this page means a code push; the trade-off is worth it for the design ceiling.

### Design decisions taken into this milestone

- **`/fees` not `/pricing`.** "Pricing" implies subscription tiers we don't have. "Fees" is honest for a commission-based platform — what we take when you win.
- **Hand-coded React, NOT a CMS row.** Loses Filament editability; gains animation, interactivity, custom layout, scroll triggers. The few times a year fee copy changes is worth a code push.
- **Header nav swap.** Remove `Support` from the header (it stays in the footer); add `Fees` in its place. Header reserved for high-priority decision surfaces (Listings, How it Works, **Fees**, Create listing CTA). Footer for utility / legal / info.
- **Static fee rate read from `config('stakly.platform_fee_rate')`.** Single source of truth — the same value the wallet ledger uses. No duplicate constants in the React page. If fees become per-game in M15-era, the page extends to pull the rate per selected game.
- **Calculator is client-side only.** No backend round-trip — the math is `stake * (1 - feeRate)` for take-home, `stake * feeRate` for the platform cut. Instant feedback.
- **Activate the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill** before designing the page so the visual treatment lands inside the Stakly palette and skips the rainbow-template anti-pattern from the M26 branded About attempt.

### Phases

**Phase 1 — Page scaffold + content + interactive calculator**

- [ ] `FeesController::show()` returns `Inertia::render('fees/page', ['feeRate' => config('stakly.platform_fee_rate')])`.
- [ ] Route `Route::get('/fees', [FeesController::class, 'show'])->name('fees')`.
- [ ] React `pages/fees/page.tsx` inside `SiteLayout` with hero, calculator, "How fees work" walkthrough, comparison block, FAQ, bottom CTA.
- [ ] Hero — display headline ("5–10%. That's it." or similar), gradient accent on the percentage, lede paragraph explaining the rate honestly (no buried costs).
- [ ] Calculator component — controlled `stake` input (USDT, min $5), instant breakdown: stake / platform fee / your take-home. Visual treatment (gradient on take-home, muted on fee).
- [ ] "When the rate varies" section — what determines 5% vs 10% (TBD: stake size? player rating? listing time-to-fill?). User-supplied content; ship with reasonable placeholders.
- [ ] Honest comparison strip — Stakly vs typical online betting/gaming platforms. Positioning: "we take less, transparently". No misleading claims — list real numbers we can defend.
- [ ] FAQ accordion (shadcn `Accordion` component, already in the project) — 5–6 entries: When is the fee charged? Who pays it? What if the match is cancelled? Is the rate ever waived? Do you ever take more? What about deposit/withdrawal fees?
- [ ] Bottom CTA — single gradient button "Browse listings" or "Create your first listing" (links to `/listings` if guest, `/listings/create` if authed).
- [ ] Header swap: remove `Support` from `SiteHeader` and `MobileMenu` nav arrays, add `Fees` → `/fees`.
- [ ] Tests: route resolves, page renders with the correct fee rate prop, calculator math holds (extract `calculatePayout(stake, feeRate)` to a pure helper and unit-test it).

**Phase 2 — Animations + scroll-triggered polish**

- [ ] Scroll-triggered reveals via `motion` (Framer Motion) — each section fades / slides in as it enters viewport. Stagger within sections (calculator inputs cascade in, FAQ entries cascade).
- [ ] Calculator output transitions — numbers count up via spring animation when the stake changes. Reuse the `useReducedMotion` hook to collapse to instant updates for users who prefer it.
- [ ] Hover / focus states polished — the calculator input has the gradient glow on focus, the CTA pulses subtly on hero entry.
- [ ] Subtle atmospheric background — single soft gradient blob behind the hero (the M26 lesson: subtle blobs work, multi-layered aurora meshes overkill).
- [ ] Verify Lighthouse perf doesn't regress — animation work shouldn't push the page past the budget. Check before / after.

### Not in M28

- Per-game fee variation UI. Today the rate is global (read from config); when M15 introduces per-game adapters the page extends. No premature scaffolding.
- A/B testing infrastructure for headline copy. Premature for a page that isn't even live yet.
- Affiliate / referral fee tracking. Different scope; if revenue-share programs ship, they own their own page.
- Localised currency conversion ("how much is this in EUR?"). USDT is the unit on every Stakly surface; introducing currency conversion UI confuses the platform's denomination.
